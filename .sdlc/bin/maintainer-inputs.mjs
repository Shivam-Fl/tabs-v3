// Everything of GitHub the maintainer agent reads, fetched before it runs, into maintainer/.
//
// The survey told the agent to `gh issue list` every open issue, and the split to read the epic's
// thread, with Bash and a read token — on a public repository, text anyone can write. The job
// could write nothing by then, but what the agent writes is still acted on as the pipeline's own:
// a survey.json entry is filed as github-actions[bot], which intake trusts and the watchdog
// starts, and from there it can be split, built and merged with nobody looking. One outsider's
// issue steering an open-weight survey was one trusted, unattended ticket.
//
// So this reads GitHub instead, in the same read-only job, and keeps only what the project's own
// people and the pipeline wrote. Anyone else's open issue is its number and nothing more: enough
// to count, nothing to obey. The agent has no shell (claude-args), so nothing else reaches it.
//
//   issues.json   every open issue: {number, title, labels, createdAt, body} by a trusted author,
//                 {number, untrusted: true} otherwise
//   pulls.json    open PRs from this repository's own branches (a fork's are anyone's)
//   closed.json   the last 30 closed issues a trusted author filed
//   roadmap.md    the last survey's roadmap, from sdlc-state (absent on the first)
//   epic.json     for a split: the epic, the decisions recorded on it, its trusted comments, the
//                 last breakdown and each child the ledger lists, with its body
