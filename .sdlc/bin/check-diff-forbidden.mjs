// `check-forbidden.mjs` reads the work order — which is written by the agent whose output is
// being constrained. An implementer can declare three innocent files, edit `.github/workflows`
// with its shell, and pass a check that only ever looked at the declaration. The reserved
// paths include the workflows, the schemas, the validators and the agent instructions: exactly
// the machinery that would have caught it.
//
// A prompt is not an authorization boundary and neither is a self-reported file list. This
// asks git, or GitHub.
//
// Exit codes, because the callers must tell them apart: 0 nothing reserved was touched; 2 it
// was, and (on a PR) the PR and the issue have been told and the issue parked for a person;
// 1 the change could not be listed at all. A tool error used to exit exactly like a violation,
// so a transient API failure was reported as "the diff touches reserved paths".
