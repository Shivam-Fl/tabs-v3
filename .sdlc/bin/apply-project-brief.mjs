// Turns an approved-shape project brief into the files every later agent reads, on a PR.
//
// Mechanical, so a script does it. The brief is a decision; writing four files, numbering the
// ADRs and opening a pull request is not, and an instruction a model can satisfy in more than
// one way is eventually satisfied the other way.
//
// It always ends at a human. `gates.plan_approval` is a config flag; this gate is not one and
// cannot be switched off. Architecture is the most expensive decision here to reverse — a
// wrong stack is discovered on ticket nine, after eight implementations have assumed it — and
// a person reads it exactly once per repository.
