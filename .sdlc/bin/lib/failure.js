// What to do when something broke — for ANY stage, not just QA.
//
// A QA failure has been diagnosed properly since root-cause was wired: an agent reads the
// trace, decides whether the original diagnosis was wrong, and rewrites the work order. A CI
// failure got a regex digest thrown back at the implementer with no reasoning attached, and
// nothing at all if the digest step did not run — the gate recorded `ci-red` and dispatched
// nobody, so a red build was a dead end that looked like a pipeline still working.
//
// That asymmetry is why the same class of mistake repeats. The fix is not a better digest.
// It is to treat a mechanical failure the way a QA failure is already treated: hand the agent
// the RAW error and its own full work order, and keep a record so the second identical
// failure is answered differently from the first.
//
// Pure functions, except parkForCooldown at the bottom. The decision this file makes is the
// one that bounds an unattended retry loop, so it is testable without a network.
