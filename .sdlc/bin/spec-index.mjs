//
// A 44-section spec was handed to the project planner as "read the issue", and came back as
// one brief whose lists are capped: forty requirements, twenty-five scope lines. Whatever did
// not fit was not refused or deferred — it was absent, and nothing could tell. So a script
// numbers the spec before the planner sees it (S-1..S-n, by `#` and `##` heading), the brief
// has to give every number a disposition, and apply-project-brief refuses one that does not.
//
// Where the spec is: `spec.paths` in config (files, or directories of .md), defaulting to
// docs/spec and SPEC.md; when none of them exists, the project issue itself is the spec.
