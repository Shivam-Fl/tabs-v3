Seeded by \`sdlc install\` from a scan. **Correct it** — an agent reads this before planning,
and a wrong entry here steers every ticket wrong.

## Stack
${d.stack}${d.framework ? ` (${d.framework})` : ''} · ${files.length} tracked files

## Top-level layout
${top.map((t) => `- \`${t}/\``).join('\n') || '_flat repository_'}

## Commands
${Object.entries(d.verify).filter(([, v]) => v).map(([k, v]) => `- ${k}: \`${v}\``).join('\n') || '_none detected — fill these in_'}

## Non-obvious
_Empty. This is the most valuable section and a scan cannot write it._

Add what a newcomer gets wrong: which module owns what, the abstraction that looks
redundant but is not, the test that is slow for a reason, the service that must be running
locally. The Librarian appends here as the system learns, but it starts from what you write.
