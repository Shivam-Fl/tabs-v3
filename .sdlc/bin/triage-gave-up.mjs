// The failure triage did not reach a verdict it could act on. Say which way, and stop — or,
// when the triage's own model run died, wait.
//
// Triaging a triage failure is an infinite regress with a model bill attached, so this is the
// one failure in the pipeline that nothing diagnoses. A person gets the two run links and the
// stage name, which is all anyone needs to start looking.
//
// It used to say "the agent did not finish" whatever happened, which was false as often as not:
// the agent had finished, written its verdict, and the script applying it had died. Three
// different things, three different messages:
//
//   - the Diagnose step failed and wrote nothing: the triage's own model run died, which is an
//     outage far more often than anything else. The ORIGINAL stage parks on a cooldown, as it
//     would have had the failure been noticed there; parking it at a person made one rate limit
//     a human touch. Only with no triage.json: an agent that wrote its verdict and then hit its
//     turn cap has reached one, and the act job applies it — parking here threw it away with a
//     false "rate limit" message.
//   - triage.json exists: the verdict was reached and could not be applied. It is attached, so
//     nobody pays for the diagnosis twice.
//   - neither: the triage never got as far as diagnosing.
//
// A script rather than a shell heredoc in the workflow: a multi-line comment body inside a
// YAML block scalar has to be indented to stay inside it, and getting that wrong breaks the
// whole workflow file rather than just this message.
