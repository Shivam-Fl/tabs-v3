// The first real ticket on tabs wrote a complete vertical slice, pushed the branch, and then
// failed at the last step because Actions could not open a pull request. Re-dispatching
// re-ran the agent from scratch — redoing twenty minutes of work to recover from a
// permissions setting, and producing a *different* implementation of the same plan than the
// one already reviewed.
//
// A branch ahead of base, for the same work order version, is finished work — unless it was
// sent back, and has not moved since.
