 * Run `gh`. A flag whose value is a DOCUMENT is delivered on stdin, never in argv.
 *
 * `execve(2)` fails with E2BIG when the argument block is too large: Linux caps a single
 * argv entry at MAX_ARG_STRLEN — 32 pages, 131072 bytes — and the whole args+env block at a
 * quarter of RLIMIT_STACK. argv is an operating-system channel sized for flags.
 *
 * Every body this pipeline posts is built from model output: a work order, a review, a diff,
 * a failure packet. None of them has an upper bound, so putting one in argv makes the kernel
 * limit a load-bearing assumption about how much an agent writes. It held until a council's
 * eighth revision of one work order crossed 128 KiB; the plan reviewer had already APPROVED
 * that plan, the post threw E2BIG, and the self-heal loop — seeing a failed plan stage —
 * spent a second three-agent council to replace a plan that was never wrong.
 *
 * A size threshold with a fallback would have kept the same channel and guessed at the same
 * ceiling. stdin has no such limit, gh takes `--body-file -` for exactly this, and one path
 * for every body means there is no size at which behaviour changes.
 *
 * spawn rather than promisify(execFile), deliberately: execFile has no `input` option (that
 * is execFileSync), so passing one is silently ignored and a command reading stdin — `gh api
 * --input -` — hangs forever instead of failing.
