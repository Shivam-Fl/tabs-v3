// The hand-off, as one call, reading the route off the ledger.
//
// Every stage used to end by naming its successor as a filename. Six literals, each correct
// on its own, and together they made the route a property of the code rather than of the
// ticket — so an audit that needs no implementer still got one, and a one-line typo still
// bought a plan council.
//
// The literal is gone. A stage says which stage IT is; this works out what comes after,
// and what "after" means when there is nothing after.

 *
 * Three things every dispatch has to do, and each was being done by some callers and not
 * others:
 *
 *   - Respect a halt. `/sdlc stop` wrote nothing a script-driven dispatch read, so a gate
 *     outcome or a review verdict arriving after the stop started the next stage anyway. Only
 *     a person (`human`) dispatches a halted issue, and doing so is what lifts the halt.
 *   - Clear the resume point. `markResume` was the only writer of resume_at and nothing ever
 *     cleared it, so a stage that ran by any other route left "approve runs X" standing: the
 *     architecture brief merged, on-merge started the maintainer, and a later `/sdlc approve`
 *     read the stale resume_at and split the epic a second time.
 *   - Say why. The rework reason and root-cause's QA run lived only in the dispatch inputs,
 *     so a retry, a cooldown resume or an approve re-entered with none of it. They are written
 *     to `ledger.pending` in the same write, before anything is dispatched.
 *   - Supersede a pending cooldown. Only the cooldown's own resume and `/sdlc stop` cleared
 *     retry_after, so a review a person restarted with `/sdlc retry review` while it was parked
 *     ran, escalated to a person — and the watchdog's next sweep read the old retry_after and
 *     started review again over that escalation. Whatever starts a stage has answered the wait.
