// The maintainer splits an epic into pieces that depend on each other — you cannot record an
// expense before groups exist. It already writes those links; nothing acted on them, so every
// piece started at once and the later ones planned against code that did not exist yet.
//
// Deliberately NOT a queue. A queue needs an owner, and an owner that dies leaves everything
// parked with no way to tell whether it is waiting or broken. Instead each issue answers one
// question about itself — "are my dependencies closed?" — and a merge wakes whatever was
// waiting on it. There is no central state, so there is nothing to get stuck.
