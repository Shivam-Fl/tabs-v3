// The `settings` JSON that points Claude Code at a model provider.
//
// `runtime.model.<stage>` already chooses a model per step. What it could not do is choose a
// PROVIDER: the base URL, the key and any headers that provider demands live outside the
// model name, and hardcoding them in fourteen workflows is fourteen places to get wrong.
//
// Empty config means the default Anthropic endpoint and the action's own OAuth token, which
// is what every repo had before this existed — so a repo that sets nothing behaves exactly
// as it did.
//
// Header names matter more than they look. OpenCode Go rejects `Authorization: Bearer` with
// "Missing API key" and requires `x-api-key`, which is what ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sends and
// ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN does not. It also requires `x-opencode-session` on every request and
// answers a missing one with an opaque 500 on its Anthropic endpoint — a 400 wearing the
// wrong number, which costs an hour if you assume the model is down.
