// Did the evidence QA cites actually survive — and is it evidence?
//
// QA drove a real browser, took screenshots and recorded a trace for the bug it found — into
// /tmp/qa-evidence/, outside the workspace. The upload step globs the workspace, so it matched
// the report and nothing else, and `if-no-files-found: warn` said so in a line nobody reads.
// The report shipped citing three files that no longer exist anywhere.
//
// The prompt had said "trace/video/HAR on" without saying WHERE, which is the same mistake as
// asking a model to open a PR: an instruction satisfiable in more than one way eventually gets
// satisfied the other way. The workflow now names the directory — and this checks it was used,
// because "the agent wrote it somewhere else" is otherwise indistinguishable from "the agent
// took no screenshots at all".
//
// And then the other half. A "pass" that cited nothing printed "0 cited, all present" and
// merged: thirty passing rows, no browser ever launched. One `touch qa-evidence/x.png` made
// every dead citation non-fatal. The "never production" and "no 5xx" rules were sentences in a
// prompt, and checkApiOrigins had no caller. A pass is what merges, so a pass has to stand on
// files that are what they claim to be, and on a HAR this script — not the agent — has read.
//
// Run twice: in the test job right after the agent, where file times are still real
// (QA_STARTED), and in the judge job on the uploaded copy, where they are download times and
// are not compared. The judge is the gate — it runs from a checkout the code under test never
// saw — so the test job names what predates the run (`predates`) and the judge is handed that
// list (QA_PREDATES) rather than trusting a step that ran beside the PR's code.
