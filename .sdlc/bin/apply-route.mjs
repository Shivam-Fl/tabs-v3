// Takes a flow plan — from the script rules or from the model — and makes it real.

// One place records the route, one place checks it against the graph, one place decides
// whether a person sees it first, one place starts the first stage. The alternative is the
// thing this framework has been unpicking since the beginning: the same decision made at six
// call sites, five of which are correct.
//
// It is also the boundary where the Router's authority stops. A route says how much
// deliberation a ticket gets. It does not say whether a human approves the plan or the merge,
// and it does not touch forbidden_paths — those are config, and a routing decision that could
// waive them is a routing decision that can ship unreviewed code.
