// An agent asking for a detour, and the Router deciding whether it gets one.
//
// The Router runs once, on a cheap tier, before anybody has read the code. The agents after
// it have far more context — a planner discovers the ticket is really six tickets, QA on a
// route that skipped review finds a change nobody should have merged unread. Until now their
// only recourse was to carry on or to stop and ask a person.
//
// The obvious design is to let each of them dispatch the next stage itself. That is how you
// get infinite loops, unbounded spend and a pipeline nobody can audit afterwards — which is
// unacceptable in something that merges PRs unattended. So the shape is: any agent may ASK,
// in its own structured output, and exactly one thing grants it, deterministically, against
// the same graph and the same budget everything else obeys.
//
// Pure. A granted detour changes what runs next on a live ticket, so it is testable without
// a network.

 * root-cause, and a debugger on a route that says `plan` (or a planner on one that says
 * `debug`). From -1 every insertion was tried from the top, and route-request read a route
 * without the asker on it as a new one and restarted the ticket at its first stage — a fresh
 * planner overwrote the revision root-cause had just recorded, without the QA evidence.
 *
 * root-cause hands straight to `implement` (nextStage), so it stands where implement does: a
 * stage placed after it runs after the implementer. `debug` and `plan` fill the same slot.
