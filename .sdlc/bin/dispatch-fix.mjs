// One path out of every mechanical failure, whichever stage produced it.
//
// Before this, a QA failure was diagnosed by an agent that read the trace and put the
// original diagnosis on trial, while a CI failure got a regex digest and — if the gate was
// the thing that noticed — nothing at all. `gate-outcome.mjs` recorded `ci-red` and
// dispatched nobody. A red build was a dead end that looked exactly like a pipeline still
// working, which is this repo's signature failure: you find out by noticing that nothing
// happened.
//
// What this does, in order:
//   1. collect the RAW error, not a summary of it
//   2. reduce it to a signature that survives a fixer editing the file underneath it
//   3. record it on the ledger, so the second identical failure is answerable
//   4. decide: fix it, put the diagnosis on trial, or stop and ask a person
//   5. dispatch that, and say so where someone is looking
//
// The decision itself lives in lib/failure.js and is pure, because it is the thing that
// bounds an unattended retry loop.
