// Applies — or refuses — a detour an agent asked for in its own output.
//
// The instinct this replaces is "let any agent hand off to any other agent". That is right in
// spirit and disastrous if built literally: a flat network where every agent picks its own
// successor is how you get infinite loops, unbounded spend and a pipeline nobody can audit
// after the fact. So agents ask, in their structured output, and exactly one thing decides —
// this one, deterministically, against the same graph and budget as everything else.
//
// Refusals are as loud as grants. An agent that asked for a review and did not get one should
// find out on the issue, not by noticing the review never happened.
