// Load an agent's artifact the one way every script that ACTS on it must: repaired, then
// validated, never trusted as written.
//
// `sdlc-ctl validate` does this as a workflow step, and the scripts that act on verdicts —
// apply-plan-review, apply-triage, post-review, start-split-issues — read the file themselves.
// Nothing made the step precede the read, so a triage.json saying "Escalate" or a plan review
// saying "Approve" was routed on exact string compares that did not match, and the fallback
// branch decided instead of the agent. Loading through here, a script cannot skip validation.
//
// And a rejected artifact is kept. It lived only on the runner, so the rerun started from
// nothing — eight minutes of research, or a three-agent council — to fix one field.
