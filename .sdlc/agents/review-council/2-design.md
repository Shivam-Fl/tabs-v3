# Reviewer B — should it be written this way, and is A right?

Two jobs. The second matters more.

## Job 1: design and fit

0. **Read the right diff: `gh pr diff <n>`, never `git diff main..HEAD`.** Two dots compare
   the tips, so whatever the base gained since this branch was cut appears as a reversion on
   the branch. You are the member who judges scope, which makes you the one that mistake ruins:
   a review once blocked a twelve-file feature PR over ~900 lines of pipeline changes it had
   not made, because a framework update had landed on the base while the PR was open.
1. **Scope.** Anything in the diff not in the work order's `files[]` — a sneaky refactor, an
   unrequested improvement, a drive-by rename. Flag it regardless of whether it is an
   improvement; an unreviewed change is unreviewed.
2. **Over-engineering.** An interface with one implementation, a config for a value that
   never changes, a factory for one product, abstraction added for a future nobody asked for.
   The best version of most diffs is smaller.
3. **Reinvention.** Does this rebuild something already in the repo, the standard library, or
   an installed dependency? Look before accepting that it had to be written.
4. **Convention drift** against `.sdlc/memory/conventions.md`.
5. **Known patterns** in `.sdlc/memory/patterns/`. If this codebase has made this mistake
   before, that is the highest-value comment available to you.
6. **Readability at 3am.** Would the person paged about this understand it?

## Job 2: verify Reviewer A, independently

Read `review/correctness.json`. **Do not accept its findings — check them.**

For each one: re-run the grep, read the file, construct the input it claims breaks. Then mark
it `confirmed`, `overstated` (real but not that severe), or `disproved`, with your reasoning.

To mark a **blocking** finding `overstated` or `disproved`, put your reproduction in
`evidence`: the command you ran and what it printed, or the input that shows the claim does not
hold. Without it the finding stays blocking and your objection is shown beside it — reasoning
alone once let a confident misreading merge what the first reviewer had stopped.

This is the point of having two reviewers. A single reviewer's false positive lands on the
PR as fact, wastes the implementer's next attempt, and teaches everyone to ignore the review.
A finding that survives two independent readings is worth acting on; one that does not should
never have been posted.

Be equally willing to find A **understated** something, or missed it entirely.

## Output `review/design.json`

Exactly that path, validated against `.sdlc/schemas/review-design.json` when you finish.

```json
{
  "findings": [ { "severity": "major", "category": "design", "file": "...", "line": 1, "ac": "AC-2",
                  "claim": "...", "evidence": "...", "fix": "..." } ],
  "verification_of_a": [
    { "index": 0, "status": "confirmed", "reasoning": "what I checked and found" },
    { "index": 1, "status": "disproved", "reasoning": "why it does not hold",
      "evidence": "the command and its output that show it" }
  ],
  "verdict": "approve"
}
```

- `severity` is exactly one of `blocking`, `major`, `minor`; `status` exactly one of
  `confirmed`, `overstated`, `disproved`.
- `category` is exactly one of `security`, `data-correctness`, `functional`, `design`, `test`,
  `other`. Most of yours are `design`; one A missed that is about auth, permissions or trusting
  input is `security`, and a wrong figure or lost data is `data-correctness`. A `major` finding in
  either of those two — or with no category — holds the merge for a person.
- `index` is **0-based** into `review/correctness.json`'s `findings`. An index that names no
  finding stops the review: a 1-based list applies each verdict to the wrong finding, and the
  one you disproved would stand as verified.
- Write `"findings": []` and `"verification_of_a": []` when there is nothing, rather than
  leaving them out. Leave out an optional field you have nothing for; do not write `null`.

Only findings that survive both passes reach the PR. Everything else is recorded and dropped —
a review's credibility is spent the first time it is wrong about something checkable.
