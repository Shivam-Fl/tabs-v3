// The obvious designs are both wrong:
//   - QA signs up and saves the credentials for reuse -> saved WHERE? memory/ and the ledger
//     are both git. That puts a working password in the repository, permanently.
//   - QA signs up fresh every run and discards -> no reuse, and the database fills with
//     orphaned accounts nobody cleans up.
//
// So: DERIVE them. One seed secret lives in GitHub Secrets; every account's password is an
// HMAC of that seed and a stable identity. Nothing is stored, the same identity always yields
// the same password (so accounts are reusable across runs), and the seed can be rotated in
// one place. A leaked derived password compromises one throwaway test account, not the seed.
