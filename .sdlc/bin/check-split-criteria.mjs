// Refuses a work order that neither answers nor defers a criterion the split gave this issue —
// in the plan gate, BEFORE the plan is kept on the ledger.
//
// This ran only in post-work-order, after the gate had stashed the plan as validated and the
// reviewer as approved. It died there before anything cleared either stash, so every retry the
// failure path started restored the same plan (plan-strategy's `resume` or `review`), re-posted
// it and died on the same line; only a person's `/sdlc reject` got out. Here the plan is refused
// as the validator refuses one: kept as rejected_artifacts["work-order"], which plan-strategy
// hands the next planner as previous-output.json, and any stash of it is dropped — a resumed or
// re-reviewed plan reaches this step too, and left stashed it would be restored again.
