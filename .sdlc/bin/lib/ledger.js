// qa-pass to qa when a rule changed, qa-fail to planning when root-cause was wired, qa-fail to

// carry weight are the exceptions written underneath:
//

//   - MERGED may only follow qa-pass (or a human). Everything else is bookkeeping; this is
//     the state that means code reached the default branch.
