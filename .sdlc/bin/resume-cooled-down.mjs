// Restarts issues that were parked to wait out a provider outage.
//
// An agent runtime that fails before producing anything is almost always a rate or a quota
// limit, and the right answer is to wait — not to retry immediately (which proves the limit
// is still there and burns an attempt) and not to stop for a person (which, at 2am, means the
// pipeline is done for the night over something that cleared itself in twenty minutes).
//
// So those failures park with a `retry_after` on the ledger (lib/failure.js parkForCooldown),
// and this — the only thing in the framework that runs on a clock — starts them again once the
// time has passed. Bounded by `runtime_retries`, because a quota that has not returned in four
// cooldowns is not an outage any more, it is a wall, and a person should hear about it.
//
// Everything about WHICH stage and HOW is resolved before the cooldown is consumed. This used to
// delete retry_after, spend a cooldown, move the label and announce "starting qa again" — and
// only then notice there was no PR to start it on, and quietly `continue`.
