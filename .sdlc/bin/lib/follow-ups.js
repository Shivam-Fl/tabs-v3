// ticket produced two or three more, each a full plan-implement-review-QA cycle, and each of
// THOSE produced its own (growth-os: #43 -> #44 and #47, #45 -> #46 and #48, #39 -> #40). Worse,
// review filed on every approval, including rounds whose findings a later round fixed, and a
// PR that never merged still left tickets about code that never landed.
//
// Now both keep what they found on the issue's ledger — review every approval's leftovers, QA
// every run's pre-existing bugs, each added to its own earlier list — and the lot is
// filed once, as one ticket, when the PR merges: on-merge files it after every merge, the
// pipeline's or a person's, just before it wakes what depends on the issue — so the follow-up,
// blocked on it, is offered a slot at once. The ledger records it, so it is never filed twice.
